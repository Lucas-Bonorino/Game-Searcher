# Game Searcher
This is a search engine for finding games based on a series of filters. 

# Current features:
1. API which allows for searching based on any data of the game: name, keywords(present on the description of the game), release date or tags
2. Authentication system for blocking the usage of some features through the API
3. Front end which allows for the easy usage of the search system (currently only allows search by tag) 

# Future features
1. Front end for authentication system
2. Advanced filtering through the front end 
3. Improvements on the UI design to implement responsiveness
